**​🛰️ ISS Orbital Parameter Visualizer**
​✨ Project Elevator Pitch
​A resilient, web-based tool built for Hack Club Moonshot that fetches and visualizes the core orbital mechanics of the International Space Station (ISS). By parsing raw TLE (Two-Line Element) data from CelesTrak, this dashboard provides a snapshot of the ISS's Inclination, Eccentricity, and Mean Motion—the critical factors defining its path around Earth.

​This project pivots to using the CelesTrak API (which provides updated TLE files) and employs a TLE-parsing algorithm in JavaScript. This ensures the visualization always uses the latest, high-quality orbital data, demonstrating data resilience and technical depth beyond a simple API call.
